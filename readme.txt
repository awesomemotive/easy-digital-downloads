== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I Show My Shopping Cart? =

There are three ways you can show the downloads shopping cart:

1. Use the short code and simply place [download_cart] on a page or within a text widget.

2. Use the included widget. Go to Appearance > Widgets and place the "Downloads Cart" widget into any widget area available.

3. Use the template tag and place the following the template file of your choosing:

`echo edd_shopping_cart();`

= My Payments Marked as Pending = 

There are several reasons this happens. Please follow the suggestions [here](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/documentation/faqs/).

= Getting a 404 error? =

To get rid of the 404 error when viewing a download, you need to resave your permalink structure. Go to Settings > Permalinks and click "Save Changes".

= How do I Show the User's Purchase History? =

Place the [purchase_history] short code on any page.

If you want to just show a list of the files the user has purchased, use the [download_history] short code instead.

= Can I Setup an Affiliate System? =

Yes! EDD has an add-on that provides a complete affiliate system that you can use to award commissions to your affiliate marketers.
