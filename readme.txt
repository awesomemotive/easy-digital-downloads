== Upgrade Notice ==
IMPORTANT: Upgrading from Easy Digital Downloads 2.x to 3.0+ is a major release that includes many improvements and changes. You will be asked to perform database maintenance once installed. Please ensure you make a backup of your site prior to upgrading. Your site should remain functional during this maintenance, but as with all updates, it is best to make a backup of your site prior to updating.

Easy Digital Downloads 3.0+ was a substantial change to the way that EDD stores data and builds reporting. If you've created any custom integrations for payment processors, file downloads, billing changes, subscriptions, or custom reporting you will want to ensure you test these changes on a staging copy of your site before running the upgrade.
