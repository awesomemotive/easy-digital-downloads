[See the free themes here.](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/themes/?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=faq_tab&utm_term=free_themes&utm_content=faqs&utm_campaign=readme)

= Is there a sample import file I can use to setup a demo store? =

Yes! Simply go to Tools > Import and install the WordPress Importer, then navigate to wp-content/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/assets/ and select the sample-products-import.xml file. This will create several sample products and plugin pages for you.

Yes! We do have a [basic import solution](http://docs.easydigitaldownloads.com/article/216-can-i-import-and-export-products?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=faq_tab&utm_term=import_addon&utm_content=faqs&utm_campaign=readme) that imports a CSV file, so if you can get your data into the appropriate format then we can import it.
