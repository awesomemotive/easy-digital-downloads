/**
 * An item variation, representing a product for sale, in the Catalog object model. Each
 * [item]($m/CatalogItem) must have at least one
 * item variation and can have at most 250 item variations.
 *
 * An item variation can be sellable, stockable, or both if it has a unit of measure for its count for
 * the sold number of the variation, the stocked
 * number of the variation, or both. For example, when a variation representing wine is stocked and
 * sold by the bottle, the variation is both
 * stockable and sellable. But when a variation of the wine is sold by the glass, the sold units cannot
 * be used as a measure of the stocked units. This by-the-glass
 * variation is sellable, but not stockable. To accurately keep track of the wine's inventory count at
 * any time, the sellable count must be
 * converted to stockable count. Typically, the seller defines this unit conversion. For example, 1
 * bottle equals 5 glasses. The EDD\Vendor\Square API exposes
 * the `stockable_conversion` property on the variation to specify the conversion. Thus, when two
 * glasses of the wine are sold, the sellable count
 * decreases by 2, and the stockable count automatically decreases by 0.4 bottle according to the
 * conversion.
